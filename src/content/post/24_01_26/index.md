## Understanding the Difference: Parameters vs. Arguments in Programming

In programming, "parameter" and "argument" are often used interchangeably.

However these two concepts play distinct roles in function definitions and function calls.

In this minute read let's learn to differentiate between the two and gain a clearer understanding.

### Parameter

**A variable in a function definition.**

It represents a piece of data that is passed into the function when it is called. Think of this as the *placeholder* for the actual value that will be supplied.

### Argument

**The actual value that is passed into a function when it is called.**

Arguments *replace* parameters in the function definition.

The key difference between a parameter and an argument: a parameter's role is in the function definition, an argument's role is during the function call.

## Example

Consider:

  ```js
    function calculateArea(length, width) {
      return length * width
    } 
  ```

  `length` and `width` are parameters in the function definition.

  ```js
    calculateArea(3, 4) 
  ```

  `3` and `4` are arguments passed into the function.

## Sumary

**Parameters** are *placeholders* in function definitions, while **arguments** are the actual *values* passed to functions when they are called. 

Knowing this difference in their meanings allows us to communicate more clearly and accurately about software.
